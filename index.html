                  <li><strong>1944: </strong>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
                  <li><strong>1945: </strong> Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>
                  <li><strong>1953: </strong>crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br> creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
